1870	1	a	$TSLA the bears are getting tricked today.  Musk wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to discuss numbers at the meeting.  The numbers need to be audited and presented in earnings.  Yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s meeting went great and today was a trap

1872	1	a	$TSLA Tesla will either make people very very rich or put them in the poor house. Once they start hitting deliveries and even sniff profitability...people won&#39;t be able to purchase the stock fast enough... Tesla isn&#39;t going anywhere!

1878	1	a	$TSLA No one understands what investments are. Tesla is taking their profit and investing it for further growth. It is better than the capital sitting there and depreciating away. When has any business gained any profit without putting money in and waiting for a return?
1879	1	a	$TSLA no reasonable explanation for drop today. just pure manipulation by greedy short sellers.
1880	1	a	$TSLA  15.19M shares traded .. it took 9.7M shares or 63% short volume to bring it down 7.8% from $225.7.. \n\nShorts have a measured and overwhelming size of trade to make the predetermined SP set in the stone! \n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s 2b in short just today alone!!

5180	0	a	$TSLA It seems the permabulls are forgetting that Elon held deliveries from the first quarter so he could artificially boost second quarter deliveries.  Everything with this crook is about misleading the gullible public. https://twitter.com/danahull/status/1143750763719479296?s=21
5181	0	a	$TSLA You have to think why production VP resigned or got fired. It has to do with production. It is very obvious. It should make longs very nervous.
5182	0	a	$TSLA if the chatter is correct and they deliver the same as last Q. This stock will visit 100 in no time. They will dump it with no recovery.

5188	0	a	$TSLA By the way... As mentioned many times. Sustainabilty is key to any company. If TSLA has to sweat to get 90-100K cars which will not get them to the minimum promise of 360K cars. Everyone professional will question weather he will have to do this every Quarter. All car manufacturers don&#39;t have to sweat. They have to worry about selling the car. Not producing and delivering them.

6146	0	a	so based on $UBER $LYFT which I did say take almost every IPO and short it. They all came in with massive debt. Read up on Venture Capital and Private Equity. Investors want to get their money back. Notice the UBER IPO at the open. They got so desperate trying to get the right price that the CEO gave the green light on anything and dumped it. He didn&#39;t care. It is probably not even trading at the right price. But REALLY $TSLA should be trading at this altitude. This stock is history. You have to be a moron. If it was trading with the other automotive industry I would give them maybe a chance... but they would have to get rid of their debt. Look at their bonds. A massive payment is up in November and how is Elon Musk going to pay it.

So here is the DEAL and consult with your bank!!!! $SPY They will not NOTIFY YOU!. You need to keep a close eye on the stock before the company declares bankruptcy. They declare bankruptcy your shares may be locked. I was told by Fidelity that Enron shorts still have some of their shares locked and they can&#39;t release them until they go through litigation. #Enron. So as soon as I see this stock going down in flames I am going to cover way way before they announce bankruptcy. There is no way I want my cash locked. $STUDY PAY ATTENTION AND ASK QUESTIONS TO YOUR BANK.

413	1	a	$AMZN So where is @Banana3???  Waiting for the much anticipated evening study session.
414	1	a	$AMZN \n\nS&amp;P 500 with VIX trend (10MA -1SD)\n\nSo this is a trend line I have studied for a few years and has been a good way for me to foreshadow trends at times.\n\nNothing is perfect or guaranteed in this business so we look for clues that help us gauge probabilities and risk/reward.\n\nSo basically this is a different way to look at the VIX that has some math that smooths out some noise.\n\nFirst let me highlight the bullish divergence and then highlight the trend after&gt;&gt;
415	1	a	$AMZN 2000+ tomorrow
416	1	a	$AMZN \n\nTonight I want to cover a few brief charts since we covered a lot last night and call it&gt;&gt;\n\nS&amp;P 500 with VIX trend (10MA -1SD)\nNDX 100 vs VIX Bullish Divergence\nAMZN a few different style charts

424	1	a	$AMZN \n\nNDX 100 vs VIX Bullish Divergence&gt;&gt;\n\nI wanted show another look at the VIX with its bullish Divergence and how Big Cap Tech reacted last time and if we can see and clues and \xe2\x80\x9ctells\xe2\x80\x9d&gt;&gt;\n\nSo here we see in this chart I threw in an Oscillator that I use to see what happens to the NDX 100 when it crosses the 0.0% line...and we see that the last time there was a rally for at least a month&gt;&gt;
425	1	a	$AMZN 2000

430	1	a	$AMZN Relax Trader! Mission accomplished!  Another brilliant  move by Trump. He&#39;s already changed the way the Fed thinks.

435	1	a	$AMZN Powell didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the memo \xf0\x9f\xa4\x94\xf0\x9f\xa4\x94
436	1	a	$AMZN Re-post\xe2\x80\x94 again- if you missed this! Dwyer is 10000% correct! The fed should not of raised in December! And with inflation still running well below their mandate; in the face of tariffs that are inflationary &amp; have been in place yet inflation is still below target! Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t Powell cut! Bizarre! In fact the best question at that news conference- if you\xe2\x80\x99re projecting a rate cut in future won\xe2\x80\x99t many investors hold off for lower rates\xf0\x9f\xa7\x90\xf0\x9f\xa7\x90. So by the feds very approach they just might be creating further slowdown! If I were Trump- I\xe2\x80\x99d be bullshit! This fight with the world to make better deals for US- THE AMERICAN PEOple- could of been made easier with a normal thinking fed! So who benefits is trump wins all these trade battles?? Even a dumb democrat should know thst answer! Wanting to see trump fail is analogous to wanting to see your home country fail! Where\xe2\x80\x99s the lie?

455	1	a	$BYND some people want to short it now.\n Because it&#39;s overvalued (obviously) but my case and point is $TLRY  \nThis is simple basic supply and demand. \n- The stock has a 9.6 MM float.\n- 50% SHORT Interest @ over 80% costs \n- They got a good PR team. \n- Multiple outlets. \n- $MCD CEO on the board of BYND\n- Sold in retailer across the world like Wholefoods aka $AMZN\n- Huge spike in brand recognition. \n- So why short it now unless it&#39;s a scalp??? \n Take the short when the lock up expires and just go on a vacation until the dilution &amp; the selling should have stopped. I rather take the easy trade.\n FD: I&#39;m still long from 66s (Use common sense and a SL obviously) I wouldn&#39;t recommend holding a overnight short and its squeezed so many shorts out.  Some FURU&#39;s were screaming short at 60s and took a nasty loss.

1124	1	a	$AMZN just waiting for the G20 .\nThis grant will tell you who is the boss
1125	1	a	$AMZN probably going to dip until 1pm tomorrow then at   1:08 start heading north and never stop until 8pm
1126	1	a	$AMZN Healthy consolidation for the next leg up.  Now worries here IMO as long as bulls defend $1891.  Weekly chart.
1127	1	a	$AMZN \n\nI mentioned the 1995 scenario before Tony Dwyer started to speak of it and present it on CNBC.\n\nI also mentioned during and just prior to the correction in May that we could get 5-10% correction around May 3-14 based off the Seasonal Road Map studies we did...in that same token I believed that the 1995 correction that came later on this chart was what we had in May. \n\n1995 has many similarities to what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing today especially with interest rates
1128	1	a	$AMZN $DIS  \n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s another view of the Disney longterm base breakout with a measured move to $150-160&gt;&gt;
1129	1	a	$AMZN $DIS \n\n...(continued) sorry the image didn\xe2\x80\x99t attach to last post regarding medium to longer term view of DIS going to $150

1131	1	a	$AMZN \n\nOne thing I know for sure is I\xe2\x80\x99m not a theoretical physicist. Another thing I know for sure is they are smarter than me. \n\nSo after I do all my research and hypothesis and write it down and share with u guys- I compare my studies to someone smarter than me- sounds reasonable &gt;&gt;\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s what a theoretical physicist thinks about the upcoming market moves&gt;&gt;\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-12/marko-kolanovic-says-trump-recession-stock-tilts-won-t-last
1132	1	a	$AMZN \n\n...(continued) from the previous post regarding Mike Santoli Presentation..\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s one I presented from a while ago&gt;&gt;\n\nThe concept is the same. It\xe2\x80\x99s a long consolidation concept. In this chart is looking even farther out on yearly concept. But u will see the idea&gt;&gt;
1133	1	a	$AMZN $NFLX  \n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s a better view of that Fibonacci study on NFLX to 374&gt;&gt;
1134	1	a	$AMZN $NFLX \n\nNFLX had the 374 fib extension posted on this chart a few presentations ago&gt;&gt;\n\nExactly what we hit today&gt;&gt;
1135	1	a	$AMZN \n\n...(continued) and here\xe2\x80\x99s what happened after it did that work we just discussed in the last two posts&gt;&gt;
1136	1	a	$AMZN \n\n...(continued) so here\xe2\x80\x99s a look at the last time Amazon broke above the daily cloud and consolidated above it&gt;&gt;\n\nIt did that work to get above and then started with a little consolidation candle similar to what we saw in the current instance in the previous chart&gt;&gt;
1137	1	a	$AMZN $DIS \n\nDisney additional chart thoughts&gt;&gt;
1138	1	a	$AMZN \n\nAmazon weekly chart view&gt;&gt;
1139	1	a	$AMZN \n\nAmazon thoughts on the 4hr chart&gt;&gt;&gt;
1140	1	a	$AMZN $SPY \n\nSome proprietary Oscillators I use around High Yield Bonds\xe2\x80\x94 have kicked up above a mean line that the last two times it did it was in the beginning of 2016 after the correction and then just recently in December 2018 correction and then just now in May. The prior two times resulted in strong \xe2\x80\x9cinitiation\xe2\x80\x9d of  uptrends. Not the end of them.

1144	1	a	$AMZN when every single democrat running in 2020 has a platform of: increase corporate tax cuts- which will obviously cut profits &amp; shrink valuations- translation- Lower stock prices\xe2\x80\x94 lower 401k! Lower net wealth! when every democrat wants to increase capital gains tax- tax trades- tax basically how all of us earn- what will happen to the market? Yet everyday I see fools saying market will be ok if Dems win! I can only can conclude that you are beyond stupid- or you are simply lonely trolls who do not trade! Dems will tax your friggin oxygen! This will effect short traders- longs- the entire market! Not one dem has solutions! It\xe2\x80\x99s just tax &amp; attack those of us who achieved success! Because aren\xe2\x80\x99t successful people- the ones who actually pay taxes- aren\xe2\x80\x99t we the problem?? Success should be emulated not derided! I expect everyone the Dems want to give free checks to will vote for them! But do we want a weak country of freeloaders?

1152	1	a	$AMZN  \n\nWould be great if the people at Shopify get destroyed and we finish higher\xe2\x80\x94\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s very important that the idiots who kept posting on the amazon board to buy Shopify learn a big lesson. Might not work out like that- but would be a great lesson for them $SHOP

So back to Powell to &quot;save the day&quot; ...\n\nIt will not be the Trump / Xi Trade meeting to spark mid summer catalyst.

1176	1	a	$AMZN well these calls got wrecked..
1177	1	a	$AMZN It is no secret that Powell over shot the rates hikes and dragged the economy in Q4 2018 into Bear territory. \n\nToday he has to be Trump&#39;s little bitch minion and talk about - and confirm - a rate cut in July.\n\nPowell better release all the dovish doves he can today...

2574	1	a	with streaming becoming a very overcrowded business those that have broadband/cable are going to dominate the business. $CMCSA $NFLX $T $DIS IMO $AAPL is still unbelievable and they have the money to make the most massive acquisition in history if they want to go fully all out media. I believe they can do it. Now that you don&#39;t need a box and just a new Samsung TV. I used it yesterday. I was unbelievable.. and so happy I don&#39;t need to buy the box. Plus they will be able to go into gaming. IMO you could probably do all your computer work through the app. All you will need is a keyboard and mouse. They need to power up the TV&#39;s with higher processors etc. Everything will be stored in the cloud. I already do all of that except computer work. I still use a powerful computer.

What&#39;s the difference of shorting 100 shares for $1/share or 10 shares for $10/share? The capital needed is always the same ($100). Market cap is crucial not the number of outstanding shares? I don&#39;t get it. Maybe someone can enlighten me?\nBy the way: $AAPL has 4.35B float.

Emotions are the enemy of trading and we get caught in the moment . Every indication is pointing upwards.  Hold on as this is only temporary.  You are competing with computers and they certainly do not operate with an emotional impulse but rather with Algorythms and numbers.  Hang on tight and you will be rewarded.

Hope its a bear trap too. Never get emotional. You win some you lose some but this is by far one of the most undervalued stocks on the market. Atleast 30-40% upside in the next year. I&#39;ve been an Alibaba member since 2004 and can&#39;t tell you how huge this has become. GL to everyone!

4602	1	a	$AMRN $PFE Someone stated that when PFE was inquiring about Amarin the offer was $10B which kind of makes sense bc at the time the rumor was alive Amarin was worth around $5B.  \n  I believe there is still a good chance PFE revisits and ups the ante. $15B could get it done at the moment.
4603	1	a	$PFE the possibility of this administration and divided Congress passing anything seriously changing drug prices before the election or even after (if re-elected which is a 50/50 chance at best) is extremely low. Buy this dip

4634	1	a	$SBUX news is totally overblown.  A manager should have handled the situation not a barista.  Starbucks is a great company and the situation will be fixed.  People somwhow forget Starbucks got sh!+ for calling police over a noncustomer for loitering and using the bathroom and they tried to paint Starbucks as racist.  Now they want to paint them as anticop.  So called conservstives are turning out to be as whiny as liberals.  BTW up 85% in a year because customers care about good coffee not stupid incidents like these that happen in every fast food chain every year almost daily that you never hear about.

Ok it\xe2\x80\x99s sustainable but the TESLA KILLERS ARE COMING.&quot; I say to them. Soon enough Tesla will disrupt across all major industries and if they can&#39;t catch up fast enough.

6112	1	a	$TSLA  I hate the term \xe2\x80\x98squeeze\xe2\x80\x99 because I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish upon anyone that they lose their hard earned money and I find the dialectic of pro and con very intellectually barren. But what is happening is that there are 40 million people betting this stock will go down which is like 30% of total stock ownership. If the stock skyrockets they will be out a lot of money. So we are approaching a tipping point soon where those folks will buy driving up the price. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even understand short selling and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s legal. I had to watch multiple YouTube videos to even understand how it works. Fundamentally the idea of making fortunes on another\xe2\x80\x99s loss is not for me. But I concord that there is going to be a \xe2\x80\x99short squeeze\xe2\x80\x99 for the ages when it happens because when the story of the company &amp; the story of the stock become double arrows in opposite directions that\xe2\x80\x99s what hapoens. The arc of the stock will bend towards the reality of the company. But again I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish anyone any $ harm.

Similar to their 230$ share price that we are 10% up on a WEEK before ER.\nI believe they will announce a positive earning of at/above 3$ a share.\nLast time they had record deliveries (~90k in Q3 \xe2\x80\x9818) Tesla profited 312 million. \nWe just beat that quarter weeks ago and still have a week before earnings.

Now close partnership deal  with up front cash for naloxone and Fda approval before pdufa October 31 and stock will be at more appropriate level. Investors could start to have some confidence in the company. Next Q report update should be positive. Investors deserve better and Dennis wants to leave a legacy of being successful.

9470	1	a	$SPY One of my favorite tricks is to sell itm puts as a stock replacement trade for 1-2 months out. It takes less capital that way. I&#39;ll usually buy a way otm put to use as a stop loss. An example is the $SBUX trade I just made. I sold three 105/90 put spreads for September expiry. 6.80 a piece. This also allows me to take profits along the way as they expire or are closed out in profit. Rinse and repeat.

Without unfair government support in the form of rebates there is no real path to profitability. The rebates are now gone and may never return.  \n \nThe playing field now leveled history has showed us time again electric cars future.  \n \nAll electric car companies have failed in USA.

12493	0	a	$TSLA pulled Q3 deliveries into Q2.  ASP&#39;s plummeted.  S/X sales dying.  Model 3 a dud.  Losing money on every one sold. \n \nTaxpayer handouts burned through. \n \nQ2 loss will be huge.  Q3 unmitigated disaster.

12495	0	a	$TSLA My take - the Q and following Qs are going to be really ugly - all this pump is in the past playbook of these guys when they are about to report something bad. It\xe2\x80\x99s all about controlling the downward spiral at this point. If it was going to be good - they would have kept it muted to surprise everyone. Get ready for $180 soon.
